## Execution Protocol — MANDATORY
This is the only permitted workflow. No exceptions.

BEFORE writing any code or executing any task:
1. Classify the task — Mechanical, Simple, or Complex (see agents/THINKING_AGENT.md)
2. Mechanical tasks → skip to execution immediately, zero thinking
3. Simple or Complex tasks → produce execution plan first (see agents/THINKING_AGENT.md), then execute
4. NEVER think mid-execution — all reasoning happens in the planning step only
5. NEVER exceed 10 seconds of thinking on any single task
6. If you catch yourself thinking during execution → stop, report, ask owner
--- 

Violating this protocol wastes tokens and is not permitted.

## Guardrails — Non-Negotiable Behavior Rules

1. **Bug fix attempts** — if a bug or error is not resolved after 2 attempts, stop immediately and ask the owner for direction. Do not attempt a third fix.

2. **Phase summaries** — when a phase is complete, provide a standard summary: list every file created/modified with one sentence explaining what it does. Include any owner actions required.

3. **Checkpoints** — when building multiple components in one phase, provide a one-line checkpoint update at each milestone (e.g. "Navbar complete, starting Footer") so the owner knows progress is on track.

4. **Uncovered decisions** — if you encounter anything not explicitly covered in CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, or SCHEMA.md, stop and ask the owner before proceeding. Do not make assumptions.

5. **New dependencies** — lean towards asking before installing any new package. Always ask for major packages (new frameworks, large libraries). Use judgment for small utilities but flag them in the phase summary.

6. **Design decisions** — if making any design decision not explicitly covered in CLAUDE.md (spacing, animation, copy, layout), stop and ask the owner before proceeding. Do not make independent design choices.
7. **No extended thinking for simple edits** — for str_replace tasks involving only class name changes, color swaps, or text content updates, execute immediately without thinking. These require no reasoning — just locate the string and replace it.

## Coding Standards
- Always use **TypeScript** — no `.js` files
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for all styling — no inline styles
- Use **Next.js App Router** — no pages directory
- All Sanity queries use **GROQ**
- All components are **functional** with React hooks
- No `any` types in TypeScript
- Always handle loading and error states in components
- Use `next/image` for all images
- Use `next/link` for all internal navigation

## Key Business Rules (Read Before Writing Any Feature)

### Pricing Formula (Carat Adjustments)
- Base price is set per product in Sanity
- Lab grown diamonds only (for now — natural diamond toggle exists for future use)
- Diamond cost: **$500 per carat change** in either direction
- Gold adjustment (always calculated from **base price**):
  - 1st carat change: **10% of base price**
  - Each subsequent carat: **7.5% of base price**
  - 0.5ct change: **5% of base price**
- Carat range: base ± 5ct, floor of **1ct minimum**, in 0.5ct increments
- All adjustments are calculated relative to base price (NOT compounding on running total)
- See `/lib/priceCalculator.ts` for implementation

### Returns Policy
- Standard products: store credit or exchange of equal/lesser value within **30 days**
- Custom pieces: **all sales final** — no returns, no exchanges, no store credit
- **No refunds under any circumstances**

### Shipping
- All shipping: **free**
- Local pickup: **free**
- Customer chooses at checkout
- **Signature required on all shipped orders**
- Sales tax: handled by **Stripe Tax** (NJ based — 6.625%)

### Product Variants (only show relevant variants per category)
- **Metal type:** Yellow Gold, White Gold, Rose Gold, Silver, Platinum
- **Purity:** 10k, 14k, 18k, 22k, 24k — **only for Yellow Gold and White Gold**
- **Ring sizes:** 3 to 13 in 0.25 increments (3, 3.25, 3.5... 13) — rings only
- **Necklace lengths:** 14", 16", 18", 20", 22", 24" — necklaces/chains only
- **Bracelet lengths:** 6.5", 7", 7.5", 8", 8.5" — bracelets only
- **Carat selector:** only shown if base carat ≥ 1ct

## GitHub & Deployment

### Repository
```
https://github.com/chiraagkankariya/AnthonyLaurenceJewelers.git
```

### Branching Strategy
| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Production only — connected to Vercel, deploys live to anthonylaurencejewelry.com |
| `dev` | Active development — all code gets pushed here first |

### Rules
- **NEVER push directly to `main`**
- All development work is committed and pushed to `dev`
- `dev` has its own Vercel preview URL for review before going live
- Only merge `dev` → `main` when the owner has reviewed and approved changes
- Each Phase from PROGRESS.md should be its own commit with a clear message

### Commit Message Format
```
[Phase X] Brief description of what was built
e.g. "[Phase 3] Build Navbar and Footer components"
e.g. "[Phase 6] Implement carat pricing calculator"
```

### Workflow for Every Session
1. `git checkout dev` — always confirm you're on dev before writing code
2. Build the feature
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "[Phase X] description"`
5. `git push origin dev`
6. Never run `git checkout main` or `git merge` unless explicitly instructed by the owner
